# Green Roofs in Milan
## Environmental issues in Milan

Like many modern metropolises, Milan faces significant environmental challenges, including **air pollution** and **urban flooding**.

#### Air Pollution

In **2024**, Milan experienced a **deterioration in air quality** compared to the previous year.  
The **annual average concentration of PM10** increased from **27.8 µg/m³ in 2023 to 30 µg/m³ in 2024**, marking a **7.6% increase** ([Legambiente Lombardia](https://www.legambientelombardia.it/nel-2024-laria-migliora-ma-non-per-tutti-male-milano-bene-lest-lombardia-e-i-capoluoghi-prealpini/)).  
Additionally, the number of days when **PM10 levels exceeded the daily threshold of 50 µg/m³** rose to **68 days in 2024**, compared to **49 days in 2023** ([Il Cittadino Monza Brianza](https://www.ilcittadinomb.it/news/cronaca/qualita-dellaria-2024-male-le-citta-migliora-lalta-lombardia/)).  
These figures highlight the prolonged exposure of Milan's population to **air pollution levels exceeding legal limits**, with potential severe consequences for public health.

#### Flood Risk

Intensive urbanization has led to significant **soil impermeabilization**.  
In **2020**, **58.2% of Milan’s municipal surface** was covered by artificial infrastructure ([ISTAT](https://www.istat.it/storage/15-Conferenza-nazionale-statistica/poster/06_07_Cortese_POSTER.pdf)).  
This reduced soil absorption capacity increases **surface runoff during heavy rainfall**, overloading sewer systems and raising the risk of urban flooding.  
For example, in **October 2024**, Milan recorded **160 liters of rain per square meter in just 10 days**, **double the monthly average**, causing the **Lambro River to overflow** ([Icona Clima](https://www.iconaclima.it/meteo/notizie-italia/esonda-il-lambro-a-milano-in-10-giorni-caduti-160-litri-di-pioggia-per-metro-quadro/)).

## Green Roofs as a Solution

**Green roofs**, or vegetated roof systems, offer an effective response to both challenges.

#### Benefits for Air Pollution

Vegetation on green roofs contributes to **air purification** by **trapping airborne pollutants** such as **PM10 and PM2.5** through their leaves and tissues ([Ingenio Web](https://www.ingenio-web.it/articoli/quali-sono-i-benefici-climatici-dei-tetti-verdi/)).  
This **natural filtration process** reduces pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere, improving **urban air quality**.

#### Stormwater Management

Green roofs **absorb and retain rainwater**, reducing **surface runoff** and alleviating **pressure on drainage systems** ([Sempergreen](https://www.sempergreen.com/it/tetti-verdi/vantaggi-di-un-tetto-verde)).  
This process significantly decreases the risk of **urban flooding**, especially during **extreme weather events**.

#### Additional Benefits

- **Reduction of the Urban Heat Island Effect**: Green roofs help **mitigate high temperatures** in densely populated urban areas, countering the **urban heat island effect** ([Ingenio Web](https://www.ingenio-web.it/articoli/quali-sono-i-benefici-climatici-dei-tetti-verdi/)).
- **Thermal Insulation**: Green roofs provide **natural insulation**, reducing the need for heating and cooling in buildings, resulting in **energy savings**.
- **Increased Biodiversity**: These structures create **habitats for plant and animal species**, promoting biodiversity in urban environments.

## Projects in this Repository

Implementing **green roofs in Milan** not only directly addresses **pollution and flooding issues**, but also helps create a **more sustainable and livable urban environment**.  
This repository contains **two different projects**, both of which share the common goal of **helping Milan transition towards a greener future through rooftop vegetation**.

#### GreenRoof Optimizer
An intelligent advisor that analyzes precipitation, temperature, and pollution data across Milan to recommend which rooftops should be converted into green roofs. The system prioritizes locations that maximize environmental benefits and optimizes the transition from potential green roofs to actual green spaces within a given budget.

#### GreenRoof Segmentation
A deep learning model that performs pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution satellite images, classifying each pixel as either a potential green roof or something else. This enables precise identification of rooftops suitable for green roof conversion.
